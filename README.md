# How To Mod a Switch

### This guide follows the [tutorial](youtube.com) I made, although if you're not into hearing people talk use this. You will need to use this for the tutorial either way to download the appropriate files.

**All of the files are from trusted sources and are scanned for viruses beforehand.**

### What does this guide install?

This guide has the end-goal of taking a completely unmodified Switch from stock firmware to a custom firmware named Atmosphère.

fusee-gelee is currently the most widespread software entrypoint of launching custom firmware. It utilizes a vulnerability in the bootROM of the first-generation Switch systems, allowing us to boot the console via any payload we choose, instead of only ones that Nvidia and Nintendo authorize. The result allows full baremetal control over your console, including system storage backups, recovery, custom firmwares, and custom operating systems.  

### What can I do with custom firmware?

* Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens.
* Run “ROM hacks” for games that you own.
* Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games.
* Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators.
* Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew.
* Safely customise your device while retaining full access to Nintendo Switch Online services.
* More on this can be found later on in the guide.

### What do I need to know before starting?

As previously mentioned, this guide will take a minimum of an hour to fully complete. Please responsibly set aside this time before your first run-through.

## ***Acknowledge that EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. A brick is a damaged device that no longer functions; something that becomes as "useful as a brick". On the Switch, they're rare, but still a possibility -- so make sure you read the directions carefully before performing them, and follow them EXACTLY.***

### This guide will work on first-generation (V1) and modchipped Switch consoles in all regions on any firmware version.

### * Upon completion, you will lose no data, ending up with everything that you started with (games, Nintendo Account, save data, etc will be preserved). Your functionalities will only be enhanced.

### * Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off.

### * Custom firmware is not permanently installed and does not change anything on your console simply by running it. It will be entirely unloaded upon rebooting the console. However, CFW does allow you to make permanent changes to your console at your own will, so be responsible and cautious with the abilities enabled by CFW.

### * It is advised that you read the entire guide from start to finish one or more times before actually running through the guide with your system.
