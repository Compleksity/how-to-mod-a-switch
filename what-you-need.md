## You will need *one* of the following in order to successfully follow this guide:

* A PC, a microSD card reader, and a USB-C cable capable of data transfer to connect them together.
* An Android device with microSD card reader and a USB-C cable capable of data transfer to connect them together.
 * **This does not work on every Android phone.**
* A Lightning OTG adapter, a microSD card reader, a jailbroken iOS device, and a USB cable capable of data transfer to connect them together.
 * **This method is not covered by the guide, but you can read more about it at this website**
* A successfully modchipped Switch and a microSD card reader.
**If you choose the emuMMC path introduced later in the guide, you will also need a microSD card that is at least 128 gigabytes. In this path, it'll be important to disable the Automatic Save Data Cloud function beforehand, as well as making sure the Switch is set as the primary Pass-Enabled console.**

**If you must use a smaller microSD card or don't wish to use an emuMMC, you can choose to use the sysCFW path instead.**

Additionally, on a V1 "unpatched" Switch, you will need a way to access the ReCovery Mode (this will be further explained in the "Entering RCM" section). While possible with household tools, you may want to shell money out for a "jig" that inserts into the Joy-Con rail to reliably enable RCM.
