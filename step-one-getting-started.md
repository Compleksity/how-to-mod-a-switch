# Getting Started

## Finding your serial number
### In the RCM path, we'll first determine if your Switch is vulnerable to fusee-gelee, the exploit we will be using to launch CFW.

**The fusee-gelee vulnerability was discovered independently by different Switch hacking teams, who all independently released versions of the exploit in April 2018. Nintendo and NVIDIA were informed 90 days before these releases, and patched consoles were launched by mid-2018. NVIDIA publicly acknowledged the flaw in April as well. In July 2019, Nintendo announced updated consoles: the Switch Lite (HDH-001), and a new model of original Switch (HAC-001(-01)/"V2") with better battery life. Both of these new models use the Tegra X1+ (also known as Mariko, the T214, and T210B01) with a brand-new bootROM, and cannot currently be hacked without a modchip.**

**Patched and Mariko units can be identified by their serial number. This number can be found in the Settings applet at System -> Serial Information. You can also find it on the bottom of the console, adjacent to the charging port. However, it is always more accurate to use the serial reported in Settings instead, especially if you aren't the original owner of the console.**

## Determining if your Switch is vulnerable

The community has crowdsourced a list of known serial numbers which are vulnerable to fusee-gelee.

**If your serial number is on this list as "potentially patched", follow the notice directly after this list.**
*If your serial number is listed as "patched", there is nothing you can do at this time besides installing a modchip (hardware modification. It requires experience with microsoldering.).
If your system is patched, it is highly advised to keep it on 7.0.1 or lower, if possible, as there may be a vulnerability for these versions in the far future. DO NOT update patched consoles past 7.0.1 if you want to ever have a chance of running homebrew and/or CFW on them if you do not have the skills required to install a modchip.*
